October 17, 2019:
1) What’s your favorite genre for books, TV, or movies?
2) What is a reason to use Git/GitHub/version control?
3) What is one benefit of using open source software for research?

1) My favourite is science fiction!
2) I'd say there are two major reasons. First for transparency, version control allows others to see your progress and the changes you have made to arrive at the current version. And it can be really useful for when you need to revert to a previous version!
3) Licences are great when you are part of an institution but if you lose your affiliation you shouldn't lose access to your tools! I also like that open source software allows other to remix and resuse therby improving the research software ecosystem.

1) Where would you travel to if you could visit anywhere?
2) What is one source of “friction” in working with data?
3) What is one benefit of containerizing data?

1) I have wanted to go to Iceland, before it was cool.
2) The lack of metadata! It's hard to re-use data when you dont know what the columns and rows are!
3) It's helps alieviate the metadata problem by putting the data and metadata together in one place :)
