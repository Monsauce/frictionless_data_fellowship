Please introduce yourself in 1 sentence
Where are you/what’s your time zone?
What kind of research do you do? (in 1 or 2 sentences)
If you could only eat 1 food for a whole year, what would you choose?
Is there anything you really want your the other fellows to know about you?

I'm an improviser, science communicator and a policy analyst working on open science for the Government of Canada.
My time zone is GMT-5; EDT
I did my PhD and post-doc in food web ecology studying who-eats-what in an ecosystem, but now I work on open science policy and helping government scientists work in the open.
OMG TACOS :taco:
I love Lego, I worked at Lego store for a couple of years too!

October 3, 2019:

If you could have a superpower, what would it be?
What is one thing about open science that you learned this week from the article or from our discussion?
In your opinion, what is the biggest barrier for researchers being open?

Flying! I know that's a classic but every time I lucid dream I fly!
The existence of the re3data registry
That tenure and promotion scheme incentivise closed practices.

October 17, 2019:

What’s your favorite genre for books, TV, or movies?
What is a reason to use Git/GitHub/version control?
What is one benefit of using open source software for research?

My favourite is science fiction!
I'd say there are two major reasons. First for transparency, version control allows others to see your progress and the changes you have made to arrive at the current version. And it can be really useful for when you need to revert to a previous version!
Licences are great when you are part of an institution but if you lose your affiliation you shouldn't lose access to your tools! I also like that open source software allows other to remix and resuse therby improving the research software ecosystem.

Where would you travel to if you could visit anywhere?
What is one source of “friction” in working with data?
What is one benefit of containerizing data?

I have wanted to go to Iceland, before it was cool.
The lack of metadata! It's hard to re-use data when you dont know what the columns and rows are!
It's helps alieviate the metadata problem by putting the data and metadata together in one place :) 

November 14, 2019: 

Would you rather be able to talk to animals, or speak every (human) language on Earth?
What is one “best practice” for data management in the lab?
Which aspect of “FAIR” data is your favorite, and why?

Ooh definitely all the human languages. This is particularly on my mind because advancement in the government is predicated on command of both English Ana French.
Metadata!! Especially in an environment where there is turnover it’s is important to be able to understand the data even when the author is not available.
Reproducible is my favourite! Probably because I’ve done a couple of meta analyses and I wish all data sets were reproducible :)

November 21, 2019: 

What makes up a data package?
What kind of metadata would you include for the data you work with?

A data package has resources (the data itself) and the metadata 
I would have a decription of the data and more information about the variables in the descriptions

December 6, 2019: 

What is one book that has influenced you greatly?
What license did you use/will you use in your datapackage, and why? (This does not need to be a complete list)
What metadata did you capture/will you capture in your datapackage? (This does not need to be a complete list)

Not a book, but the situating open science talk by Denisse Albornoz was influential in making me re-think open science 
I used a CC-BY license to faciliate re-use but also atribution to keep track of how much it's used
I added better descriptions for my variables 

December 19, 2019: 

What is your favorite hobby? 
What is one thing you learned in the audience mapping exercise?
What is one strategy you have for connecting with your audience?
