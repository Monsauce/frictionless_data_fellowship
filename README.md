# Frictionless Data Fellowship 
Training early career researchers to become champions of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in their field

## Welcome
I am thrilled to be a part of the inaugural 2019-2020 Frictionless Data Fellowship co-hort. Through this Fellowship I and my fellow-Fellows will go through training to become champions of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in our field. We will learn about Frictionless Data, including how to use Frictionless tools in our domains to improve reproducible research workflows, and how to advocate for open science. Working closely with the Frictionless Data team, I and my fellow-Fellows will lead training workshops at conferences, host events at universities and in labs, and write blogs and other communications content.

Watch this page to see how tools to help scientists at Environment and Climate Change Canada work in the open are developed.
